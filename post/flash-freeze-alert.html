                    <strong>⚠️ Local Weather Alert:</strong> Temperatures in Manchester are expected to drop from the mid-40s to 22° overnight. Please take precautions immediately.
                </div>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Living in New England means dealing with snow, but the most dangerous winter weather isn't always a blizzard. It is the <strong>"Flash Freeze"</strong>—a rapid temperature drop following rain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When heavy rain is followed immediately by freezing temperatures, water that has soaked into cracks, gutters, and walkways turns into solid ice overnight. This expansion can wreak havoc on your home’s infrastructure before you even wake up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As your local agents, we want to help you avoid a claim before it happens. Here are the critical steps to take <strong>right now</strong> to protect your property.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-img-wrapper">

                <h2>1. Open Your Cabinet Doors</h2>
                <p>
                    You may have heard the old advice to "let your faucets drip." While that can work, a cleaner and less wasteful method is to simply <strong>open the cabinet doors</strong> under your kitchen and bathroom sinks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pipes often freeze because they are hidden behind closed doors where the warm air from your furnace cannot reach them. By opening the doors, you allow the warm air from your home to circulate around the pipes, keeping them above freezing.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Clear Gutters & Check Downspouts</h2>
                <p>
                    The "Flash Freeze" is the primary cause of <strong>Ice Dams</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Danger:</strong> If your gutters are clogged with wet leaves from the rain, that water will freeze solid tonight.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Result:</strong> The heavy ice blocks the flow of melting snow later, forcing water to back up under your shingles and leak into your walls or ceiling.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> If it is safe to do so, ensure your downspouts are clear so today's rain can drain away from your foundation before the temperature drops.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. The "55 Degree" Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are planning to travel or leave the house for the weekend, <strong>never turn your thermostat off</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We recommend keeping your heat set to at least <strong>55°F</strong>. This provides a safety buffer. If the power flickers or the temperature drops lower than expected, the interior of your walls (where the pipes live) will stay warm enough to prevent bursting.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Insulate Exposed Pipes</h2>
                <p>
                    Pipes located in unheated areas—like basements, crawl spaces, attics, or garages—are the most vulnerable to a flash freeze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quick and inexpensive preventative measure is to install foam pipe insulation sleeves on these exposed lines. Think of it as putting a winter coat on your plumbing. It’s a small investment of time and money that can prevent a massive headache later.
                </p>

                </div>

                <h2>5. Know Your "Water Shut-Off" Valve</h2>
                <p>
                    If a pipe does burst, speed is everything. A burst pipe can spray hundreds of gallons of water into your home in minutes, causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Do you know where your main water shut-off valve is?</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is usually located in the basement, near where the water meter enters the house. Go find it now. Tag it with a bright ribbon. If you wake up to water spraying, you don't want to be searching for this valve in the dark.
                </p>

                <h2>The "Safety Net": Does Your Policy Cover This?</h2>
                <p>
                    Many homeowners assume that "Water Damage" is automatically covered. Unfortunately, standard policies often have exclusions or low limits for specific types of winter water damage.
                </p>
                <h3>Two endorsements to check today:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Water Backup Coverage:</strong> If the city sewer freezes or backs up into your basement, a standard policy often pays $0. You need this specific endorsement to be covered.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Line Coverage:</strong> If the freeze causes the water line <em>under your front yard</em> to crack, you are responsible for the excavation and repair costs (often $6,000+) unless you have this coverage.</li>
                </ul>
